# About
- I'm a Mechanical turned Software Engineer with a strong affinity for continuous learning and skill development. After receiving a BSME from the University of Denver I pursued my passion for building things, working in the ski industry. Several years in a tech-oriented support role led me to my current position as a Data Systems Engineer, where I build web apps used in continuous manufacturing and work with lots of data to provide insights and influence decision making
- In addition to professional pursuits, I'm a venturesome individual with lots of interests, including sports and music. In my free time, I love to play guitar, watch to live music, and go skiing or diving with friends
